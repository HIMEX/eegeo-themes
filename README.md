# Creates and uploads themes for the environment. 
---
Themes allow developers to customise things like textures, models and some behaviours (e.g. traffic vehicles, speeds)

##Requirements:
* Windows only at the moment (some of the 3rd party texture tools we use have bugs on mac). You can replace the windows executables and make it run on mac OS X, but expect to see quality issues (poor quality mipmaps).
* Bash / MinGW (for Windows, git's bundled version works fine)
* Python version >= 2.6 installed and in your path
* Clang installed and in your path
